Yep — this is a solid, well-thought-out migration plan. You’ve basically covered the 90% case and the sharp edges most people miss. 👍
A few confirmations + optional upgrades, then I’ll answer your question at the end.


---

Quick validation (nothing wrong here)

Tarball to /sdcard/Download → correct and fastest for Termux.

Clean SQLite export → exactly right; raw DB files can bite you.

Drive verification from another device → clutch move.

2FA warning → honestly the most important bullet on the list.

Factory reset callout → especially smart given security work.


If someone followed only what you wrote, they’d be fine.


---

Optional improvements (only if you want extra safety)

1. Preserve permissions & symlinks explicitly

Your tar command is already good, but I’d slightly tweak it for long-term restores:

tar -cvpzf /sdcard/Download/termux_backup.tar.gz $HOME

-p preserves permissions (useful if you restore into Linux later)

Explicit $HOME avoids edge cases if ~ expands weirdly



---

2. Split huge backups (Drive-friendly)

If your Termux home is several GB, Drive uploads can silently fail. Safer option:

tar -cvpzf - $HOME | split -b 2G - /sdcard/Download/termux_backup.tar.gz.part_

Later you can reassemble with:

cat termux_backup.tar.gz.part_* > termux_backup.tar.gz


---

3. Extra paranoia for SQLite

If Prompt Genie matters a lot, do both:

sqlite3 your_database.db "PRAGMA integrity_check;"
sqlite3 your_database.db .dump > /sdcard/Download/prompt_genie_export.sql

If integrity check returns ok, you know the dump is trustworthy.


---

4. Git repos without remotes

If you have repos that aren’t pushed anywhere and you want them future-proof:

git bundle create project.bundle --all

A .bundle file is a full portable repo snapshot — perfect for Drive.

About your last question

> “Would you like me to give you a specific command to back up a particular folder or database type?”



Yes — and here’s what would be most useful if you want to go one level deeper:

Tell me one of these and I’ll give you an exact, no-guessing command:

1. A specific Termux path
e.g. ~/projects/prompt-genie/


2. The database type

SQLite

PostgreSQL

MySQL/MariaDB



3. Whether you plan to restore on

Another Android/Termux

Linux

macOS / Windows (WSL)




If you want, I can also:

Design a single “one-command” backup script

Create a restore checklist for the new machine

Help you verify nothing critical was missed before nuking the phone


You’re doing this the right way — just say where you want the precision dialed up.
