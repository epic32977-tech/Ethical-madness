**Carrie Heffernan** (Leah Remini) is hands-down one of the best parts of *The King of Queens* — her sarcasm, quick wit, short fuse, and that perfect mix of tough exterior with underlying sweetness make her shine in so many episodes. She often steals the show with her epic clapbacks, freak-outs, schemes, and no-nonsense attitude toward Doug's laziness or Arthur's chaos.

While the series has plenty of classic ensemble episodes, here are some of the **standout ones where Carrie is particularly front-and-center, hilarious, and memorable** (drawn from fan favorites, official compilations, rankings on sites like IMDb/Collider/Vulture/Ranker, and "best of Carrie" highlights). These showcase her at her fiery, sarcastic, and occasionally vulnerable best:

1. **Food Fight** (Season 4, Episode 13)  
   Carrie loses it when Doug becomes the taste-tester for Spence's girlfriend's culinary school dishes — leading to jealousy, outrage, and classic Carrie explosions. Her reactions to Doug's eating are pure gold and highlight her possessive, fiery side.

2. **Sight Gag** (Season 4, Episode 2)  
   Frequently praised in "best of Carrie" montages for her sharp humor and physical comedy. She deals with a ridiculous situation involving a sight-related mishap, delivering some of her best deadpan sarcasm.

3. **Window Pain** (Season 5, Episode 1)  
   Carrie tries (and hilariously fails) to make a good impression on new neighbors after a window incident. Her attempts at politeness crumbling into frustration are peak Carrie — scheming, exasperated, and ultimately triumphant in her own way.

4. **Lost Vegas** (Season 7, Episode 1)  
   Often ranked among the show's top episodes overall, with Carrie getting manipulated into a Vegas trip scheme. Her no-nonsense attitude clashes perfectly with Doug's antics, and she has some iconic moments of calling him out.

5. **Supermarket Story** (Season 1, Episode 10)  
   A Thanksgiving classic where Carrie and Arthur have epic interactions — her patience wears thin in the store chaos, leading to great sarcastic outbursts and family dynamic humor.

6. **Where's Poppa** (Season 1, Episode 23)  
   Carrie deals with Arthur's wild behavior, including a search for her missing father. Her mix of concern, annoyance, and sharp one-liners make it a standout early showcase for her character.

7. **Carrie Gets Drunk** / **Drunk Carrie moments** (Season 4, Episode 20 — often highlighted in compilations)  
   When Carrie lets loose and gets hammered, her usual control slips into hilarious, uninhibited chaos. Compilations love these for showing her rare vulnerable/fun side.

8. **Furious Gorge** (Season 7)  
   High on many season rankings — Carrie and Doug in a high-stakes, character-driven scenario where her temper and wit drive a lot of the comedy.

Other strong mentions for pure Carrie energy:  
- **Slutty Lila** (Season 4, Episode 15) — Her wild alter-ego scheme.  
- **Carrie's New Husband** (Season 7, Episode 18) — Fantasy/role-play gone wrong.  
- **Carrie Cheats!** (Season 2, Episode 16) — Jealousy and revenge plot.  
- Episodes like **Paint Misbehavin'** or **Sold-y Locks** (Season 8) where her hair/scam plots lead to big laughs.

If you're building that JSON profile for "Prompt Genie," these episodes are gold for pulling sarcastic dialogue examples, freak-out triggers, or "precious humor" lines — like her classic "Doug!" yells or eye-roll comebacks.
